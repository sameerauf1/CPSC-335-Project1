# CPSC-335-Algorithms
# Algorithm 1
* This algorithm is designed to find the index of the city to start a round trip with given a list of city distances, fuel at gas stations, and the car's miles per gallon that is able to make a round trip without running out of fuel.

* To run the algorithm, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

# To run Python on VSCode, follow these steps:

* Open VSCode
* Open the hamilton.py file in VSCode
* Open the terminal in VSCode by clicking on Terminal -> New Terminal in the menu bar
* Click the Run button in the top menu bar
* To test different test cases, modify the values of city_distances, fuel, and car_mpg in the code and run the Python file. Make sure to use valid values for these variables. 
* Note the input for this algorithms is: 
* city_distances is a list, 
* fuel is a list 
* car_mpg is an integer 
* The output will be the index(an integer) of the best city to start the round trip with
