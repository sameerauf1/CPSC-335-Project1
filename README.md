# CPSC-335-Algorithms
#Algorithm 1
This algorithm is designed to find the index of the best city to start a round trip with given a list of city distances, fuel at gas stations, and the car's miles per gallon.

To run the algorithm, make sure you have Python installed on your computer. You can download Python at https://www.python.org/downloads/.

To run Python on VSCode, follow these steps:

Open VSCode
Open a new file
Save the file with a .py extension
Write the algorithm code in the file
Open the terminal in VSCode by clicking on Terminal -> New Terminal in the menu bar
Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python file using the "cd" command in the terminal
Type "python <filename>.py" to run the Python file
To test different test cases, modify the values of city_distances, fuel, and car_mpg in the code and run the Python file. Make sure to use valid values for these variables. The output will be the index of the best city to start the round trip with, and the left-over fuel at that city.
